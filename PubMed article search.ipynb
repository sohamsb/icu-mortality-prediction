      "OBJECTIVES: The survival rate of people with HIV admitted to intensive care \n",
      "units (ICUs) is approaching that of people without HIV. We conducted a \n",
      "matched-cohort study of people with and without HIV admitted to ICU at a large \n",
      "hospital to compare short-term mortality, during 2000-2019.\n",
      "METHODS: People with HIV were matched to people without HIV (1:2) on age, sex, \n",
      "admission year and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II \n",
      "score. Applying logistic regression models fitted using independence estimating \n",
      "equations, we describe population-averaged associations of HIV with short-term \n",
      "(in-ICU, in-hospital) mortality during a patient's first admission to ICU, and \n",
      "explore whether these varied by year.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 177 people with HIV were matched to 354 people without HIV \n",
      "(71.2% vs. 71.2% male; median age: 47 vs. 48 years, median APACHE-II: 18 vs. 17, \n",
      "median admission year: 2013 vs. 2013). Among people with HIV, 73.4% were on \n",
      "antiretroviral therapy, 51.2% had HIV-RNA ≤50 copies/mL and median CD4 T-cell \n",
      "count was 132 cells/ μ L. People with HIV had higher in-ICU (24.3% vs. 15.3%) \n",
      "and in-hospital (31.6% vs. 20.1%) mortality. People with HIV had 1.69-fold \n",
      "higher odds (95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.76) of in-ICU mortality and 1.86 \n",
      "(1.19-2.91) higher odds of in-hospital mortality than people without HIV, \n",
      "adjusted for age, sex, year and APACHE-II. There was no evidence that these \n",
      "associations varied by year (p-interaction-in-ICU = 0.90; \n",
      "p-interaction-in-hospital = 0.46).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that although outcomes have improved over \n",
      "time, people with HIV continue to have higher short-term in-ICU and in-hospital \n",
      "mortality following ICU admission compared with people without HIV with similar \n",

      "INTRODUCTION: The vaccination drive for COVID-19 was launched in India after the \n",
      "authorization of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Covishield), an adenoviral vector vaccine, and \n",
      "BBV152 COVID-19 (Covaxin), an inactivated virus vaccine. As stated by the CDC, \n",
      "vaccine-related adverse events can happen. In this study, we aimed to assess the \n",
      "timing of the COVID vaccination and admission diagnosis and their effect on ICU \n",
      "mortality. The time from vaccination can help identify adverse events directly \n",
      "related to vaccination.  Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted \n",
      "across four centers in India. Patients who took the first or second dose of any \n",
      "vaccines and were admitted with non-COVID illness to the ICU were included in \n",
      "the study. Patients were categorized based on the time interval from vaccination \n",
      "as ≤42 days or >42 days. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. The secondary \n",
      "outcomes were the length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included in the study. The mean age was \n",
      "53.49 (15.89) years, and 61.14% were males. The ICU mortality was 24.57% (18.38% \n",
      "to 31.63%). Thromboembolic events such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), \n",
      "cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mesenteric ischemia were seen in 7.43%, \n",
      "7.43%, and 1.14% of patients, respectively. Six patients (3.43%) developed \n",
      "neuromuscular illness. The mortality was higher in patients >66 years, followed \n",
      "by ≤35 years of age when admitted ≤42 days of vaccination (p=0.008). The \n",
      "mortality was higher in cerebrovascular disorders and was clinically significant \n",
      "(p<0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients developed thromboembolic events and neuromuscular diseases \n",
      "requiring ICU admission post-COVID vaccination. We observed a significantly \n",
      "higher mortality in the age groups >66 years and ≤35 years when admitted within \n",

      "between June 2016 and June 2022 and diagnosed with PITS were performed until \n",
      "June 2023.\n",
      "RESULTS: 76 patients (mean age 54.9 ± 17.3%, 63.2% male, 61.8% complex stenosis) \n",
      "admitted to the ICU were analysed. The diagnosis of PITS was made by fiberoptic \n",
      "bronchoscopy (FOB) in 53.9% and computed tomography (CT) in 46.1%. The most \n",
      "common location of stenosis was the upper trachea area (57.9%, n = 44). The \n",
      "median stenosis length of the TS was 1.9 cm (median 2 cm for complex stenosis, \n",
      "1 cm for simple stenosis, p < 0.001). Complex stenosis was associated with \n",

      "RESULTS: A total of 42,037 medical records were screened, from which 11,461 \n",

      "1.034-1.042). A dose-response relationship was observed, demonstrating that when \n",
      "the APS-III score exceeded 80 points, the 28-day mortality rate surpassed 50% \n",
      "among the very elderly cancer patients in ICU.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: More than one-tenth of critically ill very elderly patients \n",
      "admitted to the ICU are diagnosed with cancer. Among ICU patients, those with \n",
      "cancer face a short-term mortality risk approximately 1.5 times higher than \n",

      "PURPOSE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has revived the debate on the \n",
      "optimal tidal volume during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some \n",
      "experts recommend 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for all patients, while \n",
      "others suggest 7-9 mL/kg PBW for those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O. We \n",
      "investigated whether a tidal volume ≥ 7 ml/kg PBW may be safe in COVID-19 \n",
      "patients, particularly those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: This secondary analysis of a multicenter study compares \n",
      "the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality among 600 patients ventilated with <7 \n",
      "or ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW. Compliance was categorized as <40, 40-50, or > 50 mL/cmH2O.\n",

      "≥7 (7.9 ± 0.9) mL/kg PBW. ICU mortality was 33 % and 29 % in the two groups \n",

      "was associated with lower ICU mortality in the overall population (odds ratio: \n",
      "0.62 [95 %-confidence interval: 0.40-0.95]) and in each compliance category.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: The proportion of very elderly patients in the intensive care unit \n",
      "(ICU) is expected to rise. Furthermore, patients are likely more prone to suffer \n",
      "a cardiac arrest (CA) event within the ICU. The occurrence of intensive care \n",
      "unit cardiac arrest (ICU-CA) is associated with high mortality. To date, the \n",
      "incidence of ICU-CA and its clinical impact on outcome in the very old (≥ 90 \n",
      "years) patients treated is unknown.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive critically ill patients ≥ 90 \n",
      "years admitted to the ICU of a tertiary care university hospital in Hamburg \n",
      "(Germany). All patients suffering ICU-CA were included and CA characteristics \n",
      "and functional outcome was assessed. Clinical course and outcome were assessed \n",
      "and compared between the subgroups of patients with and without ICU-CA.\n",
      "RESULTS: 1,108 critically ill patients aged ≥ 90 years were admitted during the \n",

      "(0.2-3.2) days of ICU admission. The presumed cause of ICU-CA was cardiac in 64% \n",
      "(n = 16). The median resuscitation time was 10 (2-15) minutes and the initial \n",
      "rhythm was shockable in 20% (n = 5). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) \n",
      "could be achieved in 68% (n = 17). The cause of ICU admission was primarily \n",

      "Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2 (1-3) points for patients with ICU-CA and \n",
      "1 (0-2) for patients without ICU-CA (p = 0.54). Patients with ICU-CA had a \n",
      "higher disease severity according to SAPS II (ICU-CA: 54 vs. No ICU-CA: 36 \n",

      "ventilation (ICU-CA: 64% vs. No ICU-CA: 34%, p < 0.01) and required vasopressor \n",
      "therapy more often (ICU-CA: 88% vs. No ICU-CA: 41%, p < 0.001). The ICU and \n",

      "compared to 17% (n = 179) and 28% (n = 306) in patients without ICU-CA. The \n",
      "mortality rate for patients with ICU-CA was observed to be 88% (n = 22) in the \n",
      "ICU and 100% (n = 25) in-hospital. In contrast, patients without ICU-CA had an \n",

      "tracheostomy (ST) complications in the critically ill patient population with \n",
      "high acuity, complexity, and severity of illness are sparse. This study \n",
      "evaluated the outcomes of elective PT versus ST in such patients managed at a \n",
      "quaternary referral center.\n",
      "AIMS: The primary aim was to detect a difference in hospital mortality between \n",
      "the two techniques. The secondary aims were to compare Intensive Care Unit (ICU) \n",
      "mortality, complications (including stoma site, tracheostomy-related, and \n",
      "decannulation complications), ICU and hospital length of stay, and time to \n",
      "decannulation.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective observational study of ICU \n",
      "admission from August 2018 to August 2021. Patients were included if an elective \n",
      "tracheostomy was performed during their ICU admission. Patients with a \n",
      "pre-existing tracheostomy and those who underwent an obligatory tracheostomy \n",
      "requirement (e.g. total laryngectomy) were excluded. Cohorts were matched using \n",
      "Hainmueller's entropy balancing. Binary data were evaluated using logistic \n",
      "regression and continuous data with ordinary least squares regression.\n",
      "RESULTS: 349 patients with a tracheostomy were managed in the ICU during the \n",
      "observation period. They were predominantly males (75% in PT; 67% in ST), with a \n",
      "mean age in the PT and ST group of (47; SD = 18) and (55; SD = 16), \n",
      "respectively. After exclusion, 135 patients remained, with 63 in the PT group \n",
      "and 72 in the ST group. Patients receiving ST were significantly older with a \n",
      "higher Body Mass Index (BMI) than the PT group. There were no significant \n",
      "differences in gender, Acute Physiological And Chronic Health Evaluation \n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Coagulopathy score has been applied as a new prognostic indicator for \n",
      "sepsis, heart failure and acute respiratory failure. However, its ability to \n",
      "forecast intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with an acute cerebral \n",
      "hemorrhage (ICH) has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to clarify \n",
      "the relationship between ICU mortality and early coagulation problem score.\n",
      "METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) \n",
      "(v2.0) database were used in this retrospective cohort analysis. The association \n",
      "between the coagulation disorder score and ICU mortality was examined using \n",
      "multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, the impact of additional \n",
      "variables on the results was investigated by a subgroup analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: 3174 patients (57.3 % male) were enrolled in total. The ICU mortality \n",
      "reached 18.2 %. After adjusting for potential confounders, the ICU mortality of \n",
      "patients rose with the increase of coagulation disorder score. The ROC curve \n",

      "showed no significant interaction, but only age showed significant interaction \n",
      "in the adjusted model.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The coagulopathy score and ICU mortality were found to be strongly \n",
      "positively correlated in this study, and its ability to predict ICU mortality \n",
      "was better than that of a single measure (platelet, INR, or APTT), but worse \n",
