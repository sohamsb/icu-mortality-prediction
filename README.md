Predicting ICU mortality using Machine Learning

## Objective
This project was completed as part of the Advanced Machine Learning coursework for the MS in Business Analytics program at The University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business. It aims to address the critical challenge of predicting ICU mortality using the Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score (GOSSIS) dataset. The project seeks to develop machine learning models that enhance clinical decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient survival rates globally.
